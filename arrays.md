# Arrays

If you want an ascending sequence of numbers stored in an array, you can use the `range()` function
to automatically create the array for you.

The following statement creates an array called numbers with elements ranging from 1 to 10.

```php
$numbers = range(1, 10);
```

You can also use the foreach loop, specially designed for use with arrays.

```php
foreach ($students as $student) {
    echo "$student";
}
```
